This project objective was to design and build an interactive app. I chose to name mine "Quintel" it shows a welcome screen when launched and leads to the quiz proper. There are 6 Questions on tecchnology and technological facts. Radio groups and buttons and check boxes were used in the design. also embedded layouts, font family, colors and themes were included to beautify the app. when the submit button is clicked, a toast message is created showing the score and remark
